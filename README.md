# 📌 Climate Forecasting in Delhi
This repository focuses on forecasting key climate variables in Delhi, including:

Mean Temperature

Mean Pressure

Wind Speed

Humidity

# 🔍 Project Overview
The project explores historical climate data and applies time series analysis techniques to understand patterns and build a foundation for forecasting. It includes:

# 📈 Exploratory Visualization

Line plots to observe long-term trends

Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to understand temporal dependencies

# 🧪 Stationarity Analysis

Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test for checking stationarity

Differencing applied to transform the series into a stationary form

# 🔧 Time Series Decomposition

Decomposed into Trend, Seasonal, and Residual components for deeper pattern insights

# 🌀 Rolling Statistics

Rolling mean and rolling standard deviation to analyze smooth trends over time

# 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this project is to build a strong analytical pipeline for climate forecasting tasks and to better understand how atmospheric variables behave over time in Delhi.
